There were plenty of strange\n              digressions. There were protracted periods of time where I didn’t\n              seem to move at all, or even seemed to be moving backwards.\n              Throughout it all, though, the Web was always there, pursuing its\n              <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O2FSuLkTSc\" target=\"_blank\">own peripatetic development</a>, somehow both serenely indifferent to my progress and yet always\n              eager to welcome me back whenever (and whyever) I logged on to\n              learn more.\n            </p>\n            <ul>\n              <li>\n                <i class=\"fab fa-youtube\"></i>\n                <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O2FSuLkTSc\" target=\"_blank\">\n                  Jen Simmons, \"Everything You Know About Web Design Just\n                  Changed\"</a>\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n            <p class=\"journey_text\">\n              And why did I keep logging back on? I think the answer was the\n              liberatory potential of the web spoke to me from a pretty early\n              age. (I know, I know: don’t worry. I realize this had more to do\n              with dumb luck - being born at the right time, in the right place,\n              to the right people - than youthful precociousness.) Quite\n              improbably, for instance, my adolescence coincided with the\n              handful of years when the Web’s residual counter-cultural/utopian\n              weirdness existed in an uneasy equilibrium with the rising, and\n              much more overtly commercial, ambitions of venture capitalists,\n              entrepreneurs, and early adopters. Serendipitously, the Web was\n              trying to figure out who it was right around the same time I (and\n              a few hundred-thousand-other teenagers with dial-up access) were\n              trying to figure out who were, too.\n            </p>\n\n            <p class=\"journey_text\">\n              With the help of Altavista, Geocities, and (then ubiquitous)\n              <a href=\"https://hover.blog/what-ever-happened-to-webrings/\" target=\"_blank\">\n                web rings</a>, we put our questions on the Information Superhighway and helped\n              each other parse the contradictory answers.

Inspired by the efforts of our analog predecessors in the punk &\n              DIY movements, we taught ourselves the basics of web development\n              and began\n              <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23567744\" target=\"_blank\">creating our own communities\n                <span class=\"text_emphasis\">and</span> our own content</a>. Quite often, these formative online experiences had equally\n              formative offline consequences - in my case, for example, my first\n              website was an underground newspaper that got me\n              <a href=\"/301a49da8e9dc2b0b3db3197023e23ca.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">kicked out of Catholic prep school</a>\n              - but conflict & personal drama were not, strictly speaking, the\n              most formative aspects of our work. Underneath it all, I believe\n              we always appreciated the fact the basic building blocks of the\n              Web - the things that we were using to build other things - were\n              freely available to anyone who wanted to use them.\n            </p>\n            <ul>\n              <li>\n                <i class=\"fas fa-file-alt\"></i>\n                <a href=\"https://hover.blog/what-ever-happened-to-webrings/\" target=\"_blank\">Hover Blog, \"What Ever Happened to Webrings?\"</a>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <i class=\"fas fa-file-alt\"></i>\n                <a href=\"https://www.avclub.com/with-zines-the-90s-punk-scene-had-a-living-history-1798241222\">AV Club / Jason Heller, \"With zines, the '90s punk scene had\n                  a living history\"</a>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <i class=\"fas fa-book\"></i>\n                <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/happymutanthandb00frau\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Frauenfelder, Carla Sinclair, & Gareth Branwyn; The\n                  Happy Mutant Handbook</a>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <i class=\"fas fa-newspaper\"></i>\n                <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/19980207011355/http://oblivion.net/oblivion/\" target=\"_blank\">Oblivion, Summer 1997 Issue</a>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <i class=\"fas fa-music\"></i>\n                <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn0IM86uC5U\" target=\"_blank\">Luna, \"Lost In Space\"</a>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <i class=\"fas fa-file-alt\"></i>\n                <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23567744\" target=\"_blank\">Hacker News, \"The Return of the '90s Web\"</a>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <i class=\"fas fa-file-alt\"></i>\n                <a href=\"/301a49da8e9dc2b0b3db3197023e23ca.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Bishop Eustace Prepatory School (\"Eustace Prep\") Student\n                  Handbook, 2020-2021</a>\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n\n            <div class=\"journey_text\">\n              <p class=\"paragraph_emphasis\">\n                I guess what I'm trying to say here is: I've always been a web\n                developer.

It also meant\n              there were zero professors on campus who could direct my academic\n              progress as someone operating at the intersection of bytes and\n              books.\n            </p>\n            <ul>\n              <li>\n                <i class=\"fas fa-file-alt\"></i>\n                <a href=\"http://s-f-walker.org.uk/pubsebooks/2cultures/Rede-lecture-2-cultures.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">C.P.

Less than a year after leaving Notre Dame, I'd done a\n              professional 180. I had a new focus and a new plan: if I couldn't\n              beat them, I was going to join them! I set my sights on a new\n              career in the financial services industry.\n            </p>\n            <ul>\n              <li>\n                <i class=\"fas fa-portrait\"></i>\n                <a href=\"https://www1.villanova.edu/university/business/academics/graduate-programs/mba/flex-track.html\" target=\"_blank\">Villanova University School of Business' Flex Track MBA\n                  Homepage</a>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <i class=\"fas fa-portrait\"></i>\n                <a href=\"https://www1.villanova.edu/university/business/academics/graduate-programs/mba/flex-track/fellowship-program.html\" target=\"_blank\">Villanova University School of Business' MBA Fellows Program\n                  Homepage</a>\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n            <div class=\"journey_text\">\n              <p>\n                Unfortunately, I hadn't anticipated the possibility that I could\n                neither beat them <span class=\"text_emphasis\">nor</span> join\n                them; more specifically, I drastically underestimated the\n                financial sector's willingness to hire non-conventional\n                candidates for entry-level positions. Although I had solid\n                references, great grades, a somewhat unhealthy love of Excel\n                spreadsheets (which persists to this day!), and a killer origin\n                story, not a single financial services firm wanted to take a\n                chance on an \"older\" candidate with an MBA but no (real) prior\n                business experience. Although I applied to hundreds of firms, I\n                only ever got a handful of interviews, and no real offers.\n              </p>\n              <figure class=\"journey_figure\">\n                <img src=\"/97c11d9ac1e397fc9b6a6ac9a261e58a.png\">\n                <figcaption class=\"text_center\">\n                  \"If at first you don't succeed, exhaustively document\n                  everything in Excel.\"\n                </figcaption>\n              </figure>\n            </div>\n            <p class=\"journey_text\">.</p>\n            <!-- </div> -->\n            <!-- <div class=\"container--journey_text--2\"> -->\n            <!-- </div> -->\n          </div>\n          <!-- #endregion Content -- Web Dev Journey Intro-->\n          <!-- <div> below closes larrymg_me--content. -->\n        </div>\n        <!-- #endregion Content -->\n      </div>\n    </main>\n    <script src=\"https://kit.fontawesome.com/d2b0003921.js\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" async=\"\" defer=\"\"></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"f5fd52175383d792d3efae48ea6442d9","cacheData":{}}
