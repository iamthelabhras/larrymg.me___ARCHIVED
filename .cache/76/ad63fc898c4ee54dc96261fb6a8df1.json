I like to think the answer was\n              that I understood the liberatory potential of the web from a\n              pretty early age. (I know, I know: don’t worry. I realize this had\n              more to do with dumb luck - being born at the right time, in the\n              right place, to the right people - than youthful precociousness.)\n              Quite improbably, for instance, my adolescence coincided with the\n              handful of years when the Web’s residual counter-cultural/utopian\n              weirdness existed in an uneasy equilibrium with the rising, and\n              much more overtly commercial, ambitions of venture capitalists,\n              entrepreneurs, and early adopters. Serendipitously, the Web was\n              trying to figure out who it was right around the same time I (and\n              a few hundred-thousand-other teenagers with dial-up access) were\n              trying to figure out who were, too.\n            </p>\n\n            <div class=\"journey_text\">\n              <p>\n              With the help of Altavista, Geocities, and (then ubiquitous)\n              <a href=\"https://hover.blog/what-ever-happened-to-webrings/\" target=\"_blank\">\n                web rings</a>, we put our questions on the Information Superhighway and helped\n              each other parse the contradictory answers.

Smartphones had yet to send\n              developers on their long march through the viewports, which meant\n              that HTML & CSS were viewed more as design tools than\n              <a href=\"https://cloudfour.com/thinks/an-html-attribute-potentially-worth-4-4m-to-chipotle/\" target=\"_blank\">business-critical programming languages</a>\n              in their own right, a bias reflected in the fact so many\n              professionals working in (what we would now call) \"front-end\n              development\" felt more comfortable in Dreamweaver than on the\n              command line.

There were zero ongoing\n              inter-disciplinary exchanges connecting my university's literary\n              scholars to its computer scientists, which meant there were zero\n              professors on campus who could credibly evaluate that sort of\n              inter-disciplinary work.

To situate this\n                process within the historical evolution of the American\n                university system, I sketched out the differences between\n                pre-professionalization and\n                <a href=\"https://www.uzh.ch/cmsssl/ife/dam/jcr:ffffffff-bb47-55f9-ffff-ffffe58ee284/LectureBerlindefdef.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">the German concept of \"self-cultivation\" or\n                  <span class=\"text_emphasis\">bildung</span></a>.

My regret\n                must have been palpable because, after class, a young Comp Sci\n                major approached me and offered to give me a crash course in\n                basic coding! I gratefully accepted the offer and, about a week\n                later, I was sitting in an empty classroom in front of my own\n                student, walking through the first piece of real code I'd\n                \"write\" in over a decade.\n              </p>\n\n              <figure class=\"journey_figure\" id=\"\">\n                <div class=\"code_block\">\n                  <span>class HelloWorld {</span>\n                  <span class=\"one_tab\">public static void main(String[] args) {</span>\n                  <span class=\"two_tab\">System.out.println(\"Hello, World!\");</span>\n                  <span class=\"one_tab\">}</span>\n                  <span>}</span>\n                </div>\n                <figcaption>The Bit Of Java That (Re)Started It All</figcaption>\n              </figure>\n            </div>\n            <ul>\n              <li>\n                <i class=\"fas fa-file-alt\"></i>\n                <a href=\"https://www.uzh.ch/cmsssl/ife/dam/jcr:ffffffff-bb47-55f9-ffff-ffffe58ee284/LectureBerlindefdef.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Jürgen Oelkers, \"The German Concept of 'Bildung' Then And\n                  Now\"</a>\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n            <p class=\"journey_text paragraph_emphasis\">\n              This little piece of code ended up having huge implications for me\n              and my career.\n            </p>\n            <p class=\"journey_text\">\n              It convinced me to take (yet another) leap into the dark and start\n              cold calling & e-mailing local tech companies.

Like a lot of small business owners, she was still\n                struggling to build & maintain her brand on the web; and, like a\n                lot of small business owners, she couldn't afford to hire an\n                experienced dev to help her. I, on the other hand, knew enough\n                about web development to do\n                <span class=\"text_emphasis\">some</span> things, but not enough\n                to convince a tech firm to take me on full-time. In short, it\n                seemed like our respective interests & limitations were\n                well-aligned.

I set down a list of professional\n              objectives I wanted to achieve in the first six months and worked\n              hard to achieve each one, a process which quickly introduced me to\n              the high-highs & low-lows of web development. Seemingly simple\n              fixes or subtle UI tweaks regularly cropped up to stretch my\n              debugging skills and remind me just how much more there was for me\n              to learn. (On the plus side, these pain points gave me an early &\n              abiding respect for CSS's elegance, importance, and underlying\n              logic.) On other days, though, when I was able to to rapidly\n              identify & fix a problem, carefully think through a dev impasse\n              using first principles, or finish implementing a new UI idea,\n              working with the Web felt genuinely intoxicating.\n            </p>\n\n            <div class=\"journey_text\">\n              <p>\n                As time passed and my confidence as a developer grew,\n                <span class=\"text_emphasis\">it all finally started to come together for me</span>:\n              </p>\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  the research, critical thinking, communication, and\n                  pedagogical skills I'd honed as an academic;\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  the bottom-line, results-driven emphasis on process I'd\n                  acquired in business school;\n                </li>\n\n                <li>\n                  the creative thrill of using code to building things on the\n                  Web I'd experienced as a teenager;\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"journey_text\">\n              <p>\n                They all formed a feedback loop that allowed me to \"earn and\n                learn\" while helping a business owner translate their creative\n                vision into a tangible set of digital assets. In the course of a\n                few years, I took my employer from an identikit WordPress\n                template website, to a semi-customized WordPress site, to\n                <a href=\"https://compatibleconnections.biz\" target=\"_blank\">a fully customized site</a>\n                built using (mostly) core HMTL & CSS functionality, learning a\n                ton about development while also building out\n                <a href=\"/5ad35f15a24d6132f42cab247ded2f26.png\" target=\"_blank\">my branding</a>\n                & web design skills along the way. Most recently, in December of\n                2020, I launched my first serious side-project,\n                <a href=\"https://marathon.christmas\" target=\"_blank\">a community fansite</a>\n                for\n                <a href=\"https://www.communitynews.org/archives/jon-solomon-brings-wprb-music-marathon-home-for-the-holidays/article_2dc3e312-c74f-5389-9edf-1b54f4e0eb80.html\" target=\"_blank\">an amazing Christmas marathon</a>\n                I've regularly listened to for decades.

If you're serious about\n                  becoming a web dev, be patient with yourself and push yourself\n                  to develop the latter while you're familiarizing yourself with\n                  the former.\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  <span class=\"first_line\">The discipline, resilience, and adaptability you'll\n                    cultivate learning how to think like a developer are what\n                    make you valuable; the fluency, speed, and efficiency you'll\n                    cultivate learning how to code are what make you\n                    profitable.</span>\n                  The latter is what will land you your first job; the former is\n                  what will sustain you over the course of your career. Don't\n                  neglect the need profitable, but always prioritize sources of\n                  value over sources of profit.\n                </li>\n\n                <li>\n                  If the prospect of learning something new, everyday, for the\n                  rest of your career appeals to you, then you may (already) be\n                  a web dev. That said, there's an important professional\n                  corrollary to continuous learning that's often overlooked: the\n                  impossibility of every knowing \"everything\" there is to know\n                  about the Web. If approached correctly, working as a web\n                  developer gets easier over time, but it will never really be\n                  easy. You can optimize for change, but this isn't a line of\n                  work (like teaching an intro-level undergrad course) where,\n                  after an initial period of intense study & practice, you can\n                  coast on what you already know indefinitely.\n                  <span class=\"first_line\">If you're not prepared to\n                    <a href=\"https://thoughtbot.com/blog/beginners-mind\" target=\"_blank\">perpetually return to a beginner's state of mind</a>, this isn't the career path for you.</span>\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n\n            <ul>\n              <li>\n                <i class=\"fas fa-music\"></i>\n                <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR4HjTH_fTM\" target=\"_blank\">The Beatles, \"The Long & Winding Road\"</a>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <i class=\"fas fa-search\"></i>\n                <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=%22magazine%20layout%22&rs=typed&term_meta[]=%22magazine%7Ctyped&term_meta[]=layout%22%7Ctyped\" target=\"_blank\">Pinterest Search for \"Magazine Layout\"</a>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <i class=\"fas fa-file-alt\"></i>\n                <a href=\"https://thoughtbot.com/blog/beginners-mind\" target=\"_blank\">Ian C.
