it branched out in a multitude of directions; it was full of criss-crossing paths that, with the benefit of retrospect, had <span class=\"text_emphasis\">something</span> like a general direction, but <span class=\"text_emphasis\">only</span> in retrospect. </p> <ul> <li> <i class=\"fa-youtube fab\"></i> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnteiRO-XfU\">Three Minute Theory, \"What Is The Rhizome?</a> </li> <li> <i class=\"fa-file-alt fas\"></i> <a href=\"https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/mediatheory/keywords/rhizome/\">The Chicago School of Media Theory's Keywords, \"Rhizome\"</a> </li> </ul> <p class=\"journey_text\"> There were plenty of blind alleys. There were plenty of strange digressions. There were protracted periods of time where I didn’t seem to move at all, or even seemed to be moving backwards. Throughout it all, though, the Web was always there, pursuing its <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O2FSuLkTSc\" target=\"_blank\">own peripatetic development</a>, somehow both serenely indifferent to my progress and yet always eager to welcome me back whenever (and whyever) I logged on to learn more. </p> <ul> <li> <i class=\"fa-youtube fab\"></i> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O2FSuLkTSc\" target=\"_blank\"> Jen Simmons, \"Everything You Know About Web Design Just Changed\"</a> </li> </ul> <p class=\"journey_text\"> And why did I keep logging back on? I like to think the answer was that I understood the liberatory potential of the web from a pretty early age. (I know, I know: don’t worry. I realize this had more to do with dumb luck - being born at the right time, in the right place, to the right people - than youthful precociousness.) Quite improbably, for instance, my adolescence coincided with the handful of years when the Web’s residual counter-cultural/utopian weirdness existed in an uneasy equilibrium with the rising, and much more overtly commercial, ambitions of venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, and early adopters. Serendipitously, the Web was trying to figure out who it was right around the same time I (and a few hundred-thousand-other teenagers with dial-up access) were trying to figure out who were, too. </p> <p class=\"journey_text\"> With the help of Altavista, Geocities, and (then ubiquitous) <a href=\"https://hover.blog/what-ever-happened-to-webrings/\" target=\"_blank\"> web rings</a>, we put our questions on the Information Superhighway and helped each other parse the contradictory answers. Together, we discovered <a href=\"https://www.avclub.com/with-zines-the-90s-punk-scene-had-a-living-history-1798241222\">zines</a>, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/happymutanthandb00frau\" target=\"_blank\"> culture jamming</a>, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/19980207011355/http://oblivion.net/oblivion/\" target=\"_blank\"> online (h)ac(k)tivism</a>, indie film, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn0IM86uC5U\" target=\"_blank\">music you couldn’t hear on the radio</a> . Inspired by the efforts of our analog predecessors in the punk & DIY movements, we taught ourselves the basics of web development and began <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23567744\" target=\"_blank\">creating our own communities <span class=\"text_emphasis\">and</span> our own content</a>. Quite often, these formative online experiences had equally formative offline consequences - in my case, for example, my first website was an underground newspaper that got me <a href=\"/301a49da8e9dc2b0b3db3197023e23ca.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">kicked out of Catholic prep school</a> - but conflict & personal drama were not, strictly speaking, the most formative aspects of our work. Underneath it all, I believe we always appreciated the fact the basic building blocks of the Web - the things that we were using to build other things - were freely available to anyone who wanted to use them. </p> <ul> <li> <i class=\"fa-file-alt fas\"></i> <a href=\"https://hover.blog/what-ever-happened-to-webrings/\" target=\"_blank\">Hover Blog, \"What Ever Happened to Webrings?\"</a> </li> <li> <i class=\"fa-file-alt fas\"></i> <a href=\"https://www.avclub.com/with-zines-the-90s-punk-scene-had-a-living-history-1798241222\">AV Club / Jason Heller, \"With zines, the '90s punk scene had a living history\"</a> </li> <li> <i class=\"fa-book fas\"></i> <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/happymutanthandb00frau\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Frauenfelder, Carla Sinclair, & Gareth Branwyn; The Happy Mutant Handbook</a> </li> <li> <i class=\"fa-newspaper fas\"></i> <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/19980207011355/http://oblivion.net/oblivion/\" target=\"_blank\">Oblivion, Summer 1997 Issue</a> </li> <li> <i class=\"fa-music fas\"></i> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn0IM86uC5U\" target=\"_blank\">Luna, \"Lost In Space\"</a> </li> <li> <i class=\"fa-file-alt fas\"></i> <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23567744\" target=\"_blank\">Hacker News, \"The Return of the '90s Web\"</a> </li> <li> <i class=\"fa-file-alt fas\"></i> <a href=\"/301a49da8e9dc2b0b3db3197023e23ca.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Bishop Eustace Prepatory School (\"Eustace Prep\") Student Handbook, 2020-2021</a> </li> </ul> <div class=\"journey_text\"> <p class=\"paragraph_emphasis\"> I guess what I'm trying to say here is: I've always been a web developer.

Again, it seems important to stress the role of circumstances largely beyond my control. </p> <p class=\"journey_text\"> When I started college back in the early Aughts, web development, at least where I was, was very much the red-headed stepchild of the Computer Science department. Smartphones had yet to send developers on their long march through the viewports, which meant that HTML & CSS were viewed more as design tools than <a href=\"https://cloudfour.com/thinks/an-html-attribute-potentially-worth-4-4m-to-chipotle/\" target=\"_blank\">business-critical programming languages</a> in their own right, a bias reflected in the fact so many professionals working in (what we would now call) \"front-end development\" felt more comfortable in Dreamweaver than on the command line. Studying web development at the university-level obliged you to study a bunch of other stuff, like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture\" target=\"_blank\">von Neumann architecture</a>, as well and, although it was all conceptually interesting enough, you went in with the understanding most of your courses would focus on things that were at best Web adjacent; there were little-to-no opportunities to develop your understanding of the Web as a rapidly evolving technology in its own right; and the few opportunities that did exist were, to borrow <a href=\"http://www.randyconnolly.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Randy Connolly's</a> striking turn of phrase, <a href=\"https://sci-hub.do/https://doi.org/10.1145/3287324.3287433\n\" target=\"_blank\"> \"facing backwards while stumbling forwards.\"</a> </p> <ul> <li> <i class=\"fa-file-alt fas\"></i> <a href=\"https://cloudfour.com/thinks/an-html-attribute-potentially-worth-4-4m-to-chipotle\">Jason Grigsby, \"An HTML Attribute Potentially Worth $4.4M to Chipotle\"</a> </li> <li> <i class=\"fa-file-alt fas\"></i> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia Entry on von Neumann Architecture</a> </li> <li> <i class=\"fa-portrait fas\"></i> <a href=\"http://www.randyconnolly.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Randy Connolly (Dept. of Math & Computing, Mount Royal University) Homepage</a> </li> <li> <i class=\"fa-file-alt fas\"></i> <a href=\"https://sci-hub.do/https://doi.org/10.1145/3287324.3287433\" target=\"_blank\">Randy Connolly, \"Facing Backwards While Stumbling Forwards: The Future of Teaching Web Development\"</a> </li> </ul> <p class=\"journey_text\"> Compounding this relatively recent problem was another, older problem: the <a href=\"http://s-f-walker.org.uk/pubsebooks/2cultures/Rede-lecture-2-cultures.pdf\n\" target=\"_blank\"> \"two cultures\" problem</a> identified by C. P. Snow way back in 1959. My academic interests weren't narrowly focused on computers & technology; I was also interested in the humanities, specifically in Continental philosophy, literary theory, avant-garde poetry, American regionalism, and Irish Studies; even more specifically, I was interested in becoming a (bonafide) professor, which meant cultivating a (bonafide) set of specializations, ideally with the assistance of a mentor who could teach me the professoriat's secret handshakes and vouch for me when it came time to apply to (bonafide) PhD programs. There were zero ongoing inter-disciplinary exchanges connecting my university's literary scholars to its computer scientists, which meant there were zero professors on campus who could credibly evaluate that sort of inter-disciplinary work. It also meant there were zero professors on campus who could direct my academic progress as someone operating at the intersection of bytes and books. </p> <ul> <li> <i class=\"fa-file-alt fas\"></i> <a href=\"http://s-f-walker.org.uk/pubsebooks/2cultures/Rede-lecture-2-cultures.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">C.P. Snow, \"The Two Cultures\"</a> </li> </ul> <p class=\"journey_text\"> Rather than go it alone I opted, quite understandably I think, to take advantage of the academic resources already at my disposal. </p> <p class=\"journey_text\"> Over the next few years, I gradually drifted further away from the Web and deeper into the groves of academe. My initial attempts to get into a top-tier PhD program were unsuccessful, but, after a brief interlude as an admin, many sleepless nights rethinking my application strategy, relentless networking, and somehow managing to be in two Master's programs simultaneously, the <a href=\"https://www.nd.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Notre Dame</a> invited me to begin my PhD under the auspices of their <a href=\"https://irishlanguage.nd.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Irish Language and Literature</a>. </p> <ul> <li> <i class=\"fa-portrait fas\"></i><a href=\"https://www.nd.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Notre Dame's Homepage</a> </li> <li> <i class=\"fa-portrait fas\"></i> <a href=\"https://irishlanguage.nd.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Notre Dame's Department of Irish Language & Literature Homepage</a> </li> </ul> <p class=\"journey_text\"> Victory! Or so I thought. When I tried to renew my lease at the end of my first year, <a href=\"https://www.irishresidential.com/\" target=\"_blank\">the landlords</a> raised the rent by more than <span class=\"text_emphasis\">$2,000 a month</span>. (Unbeknownst to me, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/312+S+St+Peter+St,+South+Bend,+IN+46617/@41.6733235,-86.2398454,3a,75y,77.81h,90t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sjngNxqZa0_KLJt2sqMxEMw!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DjngNxqZa0_KLJt2sqMxEMw%26cb_client%3Dsearch.gws-prod.gps%26w%3D86%26h%3D86%26yaw%3D77.81287%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i3328!8i1664!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x8816cd3c2326f86f:0x2bb2c386abd38478!2s312+S+St+Peter+St,+South+Bend,+IN+46617!3b1!8m2!3d41.6733619!4d-86.2395777!3m4!1s0x8816cd3c2326f86f:0x2bb2c386abd38478!8m2!3d41.6733619!4d-86.2395777\" target=\"_blank\">the property I was living in</a> was usually rented by the room to undergraduates, not <span class=\"text_emphasis\">en bloc</span> to poor doctoral students. Now that the owners had a chance to triple their unit's monthly revenue, I had to go!) Moving out to South Bend had exhausted my savings, and the modest stipend Notre Dame gave me each month didn't come close to covering two months' rent plus a security deposit. After trying, and failing, to convince my landlords to change their minds, I quietly withdrew from the University of Notre Dame, called up my family, and asked them to lend me the money to move back to Philadelphia. Almost as quickly as it had begun, my academic career was over. </p> <ul> <li> <i class=\"fa-portrait fas\"></i> <a href=\"https://www.irishresidential.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Irish Residential Homepage</a> </li> <li> <i class=\"fa-map-marked-alt fas\"></i> <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/312+S+St+Peter+St,+South+Bend,+IN+46617/@41.6733235,-86.2398454,3a,75y,77.81h,90t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sjngNxqZa0_KLJt2sqMxEMw!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DjngNxqZa0_KLJt2sqMxEMw%26cb_client%3Dsearch.gws-prod.gps%26w%3D86%26h%3D86%26yaw%3D77.81287%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i3328!8i1664!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x8816cd3c2326f86f:0x2bb2c386abd38478!2s312+S+St+Peter+St,+South+Bend,+IN+46617!3b1!8m2!3d41.6733619!4d-86.2395777!3m4!1s0x8816cd3c2326f86f:0x2bb2c386abd38478!8m2!3d41.6733619!4d-86.2395777\" target=\"_blank\">312 S.

For many, the prospect of life outside of academia seems all-but-unthinkable, until it becomes all-but-inescapable.

Less than a year after leaving Notre Dame, I'd done a professional 180. I had a new focus and a new plan: if I couldn't beat them, I was going to join them! I set my sights on a new career in the financial services industry. </p> <ul> <li> <i class=\"fa-portrait fas\"></i> <a href=\"https://www1.villanova.edu/university/business/academics/graduate-programs/mba/flex-track.html\" target=\"_blank\">Villanova University School of Business' Flex Track MBA Homepage</a> </li> <li> <i class=\"fa-portrait fas\"></i> <a href=\"https://www1.villanova.edu/university/business/academics/graduate-programs/mba/flex-track/fellowship-program.html\" target=\"_blank\">Villanova University School of Business' MBA Fellows Program Homepage</a> </li> </ul> <div class=\"journey_text\"> <p> Unfortunately, I hadn't anticipated the possibility that I could neither beat them <span class=\"text_emphasis\">nor</span> join them.

One day in class we were discussing the anxiety-inducing process of choosing an undergraduate major and, by extension, a career. To situate this process within the historical evolution of the American university system, I sketched out the differences between pre-professionalization and <a href=\"https://www.uzh.ch/cmsssl/ife/dam/jcr:ffffffff-bb47-55f9-ffff-ffffe58ee284/LectureBerlindefdef.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">the German concept of \"self-cultivation\" or <span class=\"text_emphasis\">bildung</span></a>. I'd lectured on this topic before but, for whatever reason, on <span class=\"text_emphasis\">this</span> particular day, I felt compelled to share my own experiences as an undergraduate, including my near-hit of a Computer Science major. My regret must have been palpable because, after class, a young Comp Sci major approached me and offered to give me a crash course in basic coding! I gratefully accepted the offer and, about a week later, I was sitting in an empty classroom in front of my own student, walking through the first piece of real code I'd \"write\" in over a decade. </p> <figure class=\"journey_figure\"> <div class=\"code_block\"> <span>class HelloWorld {</span> <span class=\"one_tab\">public static void main(String[] args) {</span> <span class=\"two_tab\">System.out.println(\"Hello, World!\");</span> <span class=\"one_tab\">}</span> <span>}</span> </div> <figcaption>The Bit Of Java That (Re)Started It All</figcaption> </figure> </div> <ul> <li> <i class=\"fa-file-alt fas\"></i> <a href=\"https://www.uzh.ch/cmsssl/ife/dam/jcr:ffffffff-bb47-55f9-ffff-ffffe58ee284/LectureBerlindefdef.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Jürgen Oelkers, \"The German Concept of 'Bildung' Then And Now\"</a> </li> </ul> <p class=\"journey_text paragraph_emphasis\"> This little piece of code ended up having huge implications for me and my career. </p> <p class=\"journey_text\"> It convinced me to take (yet another) leap into the dark and start cold calling & e-mailing local tech companies. (The Web had been an integral part of my adolescence; perhaps it could be it an integral part of my adulthood as well.) My pitch was fairly straightforward: I was a part-time adjunct with ~15 hours of free time a week; I had no desire to remain an adjunct; I had a business degree; I was interested in web development; I was happy to intern anywhere in their organization they thought I might add value. To my surprise and delight, almost everyone I reached out to took the time to get back to me. I had some great conversations with some wonderful people, which pretty much all ended with the same feedback: </p> <p class=\"journey_text paragraph_emphasis\"> \"You seem like a highly-motivated candidate with lots of potential, but you'll have a hard time convincing anyone to let you anywhere near a technical role if you don't know at least <span class=\"text_emphasis\">some</span> code.\" </p> <p class=\"journey_text\"> That was enough for me: I began the laborious process of teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript almost immediately! </p> <div class=\"journey_text\"> <p class=\"journey_text\"> I say \"laborious\" because I couldn't afford a coding bootcamp and was obliged to create my own curricula utilizing whatever resources were free or cheaply available. Although there was no shortage of \"teach yourself to code\" content on the Web, finding sources that were up-to-date and focused on methodically learning web dev fundamentals proved challenging, especially since <a href=\"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/discovering-unkunks/\" target=\"_blank\">I didn't already know</a> precisely what \"web dev fundamentals\" were.
