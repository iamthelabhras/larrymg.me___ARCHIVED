There were plenty of strange digressions. There were protracted periods of time where I didn’t seem to move at all, or even seemed to be moving backwards. Throughout it all, though, the Web was always there, pursuing its <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O2FSuLkTSc\" target=\"_blank\">own peripatetic development</a>, somehow both serenely indifferent to my progress and yet always eager to welcome me back whenever (and whyever) I logged on to learn more. </p> <p class=\"journey_text\"> And why did I keep logging back on? I think the answer was the liberatory potential of the web spoke to me from a pretty early age. (I know, I know: don’t worry. I realize this had more to do with dumb luck - being born at the right time, in the right place, to the right people - than youthful precociousness.) Quite improbably, for instance, my adolescence coincided with the handful of years when the Web’s residual counter-cultural/utopian weirdness existed in an uneasy equilibrium with the rising, and much more overly commercial, ambitions of venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, and early adopters. Serendipitously, the Web was trying to figure out who it was right around the same I (and a few hundred thousand other teenagers with dial-up access) were trying to figure out who were, too. </p> <p class=\"journey_text\"> With the help of Altavista, Geocities, and (then ubiquitous) <a href=\"https://hover.blog/what-ever-happened-to-webrings/\" target=\"_blank\"> web rings</a>, we put our questions on the Information Superhighway and helped each other parse the contradictory answers. Together, we discovered <a href=\"https://www.avclub.com/with-zines-the-90s-punk-scene-had-a-living-history-1798241222\">zines</a>, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/happymutanthandb00frau\" target=\"_blank\"> culture jamming</a>, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/19980207011355/http://oblivion.net/oblivion/\" target=\"_blank\"> online (h)ac(k)tivism</a>, indie film, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn0IM86uC5U\" target=\"_blank\">music you couldn’t hear on the radio</a> . Inspired by the efforts of our analog predecessors in the punk & DIY movements, we taught ourselves the basics of web development and began <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23567744\" target=\"_blank\">creating our own communities <span class=\"text_emphasis\">and</span> our own content</a>. Quite often, these formative online experiences had equally formative offline consequences - in my case, for example, my first website was an underground newspaper that got me <a href=\"/301a49da8e9dc2b0b3db3197023e23ca.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">kicked out of Catholic prep school</a> - but conflict & personal drama were not, strictly speaking, the most formative aspects of our work. Underneath it all, I believe we always appreciated the fact the basic building blocks of the Web - the things that we were using to build other things - were freely available to anyone who wanted to use them. </p> <p class=\"grid_text_center journey_text paragraph_emphasis\"> I guess what I'm trying to say here is: I've always been a web developer. It just took me a little longer than I would've liked to realize it. </p> <p class=\"journey_text\"> Why did it take me so long? Again, it seems important to stress the role of circumstances largely beyond my control. </p> <p class=\"journey_text\"> When I started college back in the early Aughts, web development, at least where I was, was very much the red-headed stepchild of the Computer Science department. Smartphones had yet to send developers on their long march through the viewports, which meant that HTML & CSS were viewed more as design tools than <a href=\"https://cloudfour.com/thinks/an-html-attribute-potentially-worth-4-4m-to-chipotle/\" target=\"_blank\">business-critical programming languages</a> in their own right, a bias reflected in the fact so many professionals working in (what we would now call) \"front-end development\" felt more comfortable in Dreamweaver than they did on the command line. Studying web development at the university-level obliged you to study a bunch of other stuff, like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture\" target=\"_blank\">von Neumann architecture</a>, as well and, although it was all conceptually interesting enough, you went in with the understanding most of your courses would focus on things that were, at best, Web adjacent; there were little-to-no opportunities to develop your understanding of the Web a rapidly evolving technology in its own right; and the few opportunities that did exist were, to borrow <a href=\"http://www.randyconnolly.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Randy Connolly's</a> striking turn of phrase, <a href=\"https://sci-hub.do/https://doi.org/10.1145/3287324.3287433\n\" target=\"_blank\"> \"facing backwards while stumbling forwards.\"</a> </p> <p class=\"journey_text\"> Compounding this relatively recent problem was another, older problem: the so-called \"two cultures\" problem identified by C. P. Snow way back in 1959. My academic interests weren't narrowly focused on computers & technology; I was also interested in the humanities, specifically in Continental philosophy, literary theory, avant-garde poetry, American regionalism, and Irish Studies; even more specifically, I was interested in becoming a bonafide professor, which meant cultivating a bonafide set of specializations, ideally with the assistance of a mentor who could guide me into the groves of academe and vouch for me as a junior scholar when it came time to apply to bonafide PhD programs. There were zero ongoing inter-disciplinary exchanges connecting my university's literary scholars and computer scientists, which meant there were also zero professors on campus would could credibly evaluate inter-disciplinary work. It also meant there were zero professors on campus who could direct my academic progress as someone operating at the intersection of code bases and codices. </p>   <figure class=\"journey_figure\" id=\"young_labhras\"> <img src=\"/f2bffdb8d6faa42863a77c3fe811a32b.jpg\"> <figcaption> NERD ALERT<br> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheMooninites/status/4731924315\" target=\"_blank\">(Not pictured: MOONROCKS.)</a> </figcaption> </figure>  </div>   </div>  </div> </main> <script src=\"https://kit.fontawesome.com/d2b0003921.js\" crossorigin async defer></script> </body></html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"c9993989cb801db7079a25186899b758","cacheData":{}}
