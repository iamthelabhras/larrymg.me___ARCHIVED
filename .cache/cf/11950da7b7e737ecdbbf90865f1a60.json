There were plenty of strange digressions. There were protracted periods of time where I didn’t seem to move at all, or even seemed to be moving backwards. Throughout it all, though, the Web was always there, pursuing its <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O2FSuLkTSc\" target=\"_blank\">own peripatetic development</a>, somehow both serenely indifferent to my progress and yet always eager to welcome me back whenever (and whyever) I logged on to learn more. </p> <ul> <li> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O2FSuLkTSc\" target=\"_blank\"> Jen Simmons, \"Everything You Know About Web Design Just Changed\"</a> </li> </ul> <p class=\"journey_text\"> And why did I keep logging back on? I think the answer was the liberatory potential of the web spoke to me from a pretty early age. (I know, I know: don’t worry. I realize this had more to do with dumb luck - being born at the right time, in the right place, to the right people - than youthful precociousness.) Quite improbably, for instance, my adolescence coincided with the handful of years when the Web’s residual counter-cultural/utopian weirdness existed in an uneasy equilibrium with the rising, and much more overtly commercial, ambitions of venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, and early adopters. Serendipitously, the Web was trying to figure out who it was right around the same time I (and a few hundred-thousand-other teenagers with dial-up access) were trying to figure out who were, too. </p> <p class=\"journey_text\"> With the help of Altavista, Geocities, and (then ubiquitous) <a href=\"https://hover.blog/what-ever-happened-to-webrings/\" target=\"_blank\"> web rings</a>, we put our questions on the Information Superhighway and helped each other parse the contradictory answers. Together, we discovered <a href=\"https://www.avclub.com/with-zines-the-90s-punk-scene-had-a-living-history-1798241222\">zines</a>, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/happymutanthandb00frau\" target=\"_blank\"> culture jamming</a>, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/19980207011355/http://oblivion.net/oblivion/\" target=\"_blank\"> online (h)ac(k)tivism</a>, indie film, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn0IM86uC5U\" target=\"_blank\">music you couldn’t hear on the radio</a> . Inspired by the efforts of our analog predecessors in the punk & DIY movements, we taught ourselves the basics of web development and began <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23567744\" target=\"_blank\">creating our own communities <span class=\"text_emphasis\">and</span> our own content</a>. Quite often, these formative online experiences had equally formative offline consequences - in my case, for example, my first website was an underground newspaper that got me <a href=\"/301a49da8e9dc2b0b3db3197023e23ca.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">kicked out of Catholic prep school</a> - but conflict & personal drama were not, strictly speaking, the most formative aspects of our work. Underneath it all, I believe we always appreciated the fact the basic building blocks of the Web - the things that we were using to build other things - were freely available to anyone who wanted to use them. </p> <ul> <li> <a href=\"https://hover.blog/what-ever-happened-to-webrings/\" target=\"_blank\">Hover Blog, \"What Ever Happened to Webrings?\"</a> </li> <li> <a href=\"https://www.avclub.com/with-zines-the-90s-punk-scene-had-a-living-history-1798241222\">AV Club / Jason Heller, \"With zines, the '90s punk scene had a living history\"</a> </li> <li> <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/happymutanthandb00frau\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Frauenfelder, Carla Sinclair, & Gareth Branwyn; The Happy Mutant Handbook</a> </li> <li> <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/19980207011355/http://oblivion.net/oblivion/\" target=\"_blank\">Oblivion, Summer 1997 Issue</a> </li> <li> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn0IM86uC5U\" target=\"_blank\">Luna, \"Lost In Space\"</a> </li> <li> <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23567744\" target=\"_blank\">Hacker News, \"The Return of the '90s Web\"</a> </li> <li> <a href=\"/301a49da8e9dc2b0b3db3197023e23ca.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Bishop Eustace Prepatory School (\"Eustace Prep\") Student Handbook, 2020-2021</a> </li> </ul> <div class=\"journey_text\"> <p class=\"paragraph_emphasis\"> I guess what I'm trying to say here is: I've always been a web developer.

Again, it seems important to stress the role of circumstances largely beyond my control. </p> <p class=\"journey_text\"> When I started college back in the early Aughts, web development, at least where I was, was very much the red-headed stepchild of the Computer Science department. Smartphones had yet to send developers on their long march through the viewports, which meant that HTML & CSS were viewed more as design tools than <a href=\"https://cloudfour.com/thinks/an-html-attribute-potentially-worth-4-4m-to-chipotle/\" target=\"_blank\">business-critical programming languages</a> in their own right, a bias reflected in the fact so many professionals working in (what we would now call) \"front-end development\" felt more comfortable in Dreamweaver than they did on the command line. Studying web development at the university-level obliged you to study a bunch of other stuff, like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture\" target=\"_blank\">von Neumann architecture</a>, as well and, although it was all conceptually interesting enough, you went in with the understanding most of your courses would focus on things that were, at best, Web adjacent; there were little-to-no opportunities to develop your understanding of the Web as a rapidly evolving technology in its own right; and the few opportunities that did exist were, to borrow <a href=\"http://www.randyconnolly.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Randy Connolly's</a> striking turn of phrase, <a href=\"https://sci-hub.do/https://doi.org/10.1145/3287324.3287433\n\" target=\"_blank\"> \"facing backwards while stumbling forwards.\"</a> </p> <p class=\"journey_text\"> Compounding this relatively recent problem was another, older problem: the so-called <a href=\"http://s-f-walker.org.uk/pubsebooks/2cultures/Rede-lecture-2-cultures.pdf\n\" target=\"_blank\"> \"two cultures\" problem</a> identified by C. P. Snow way back in 1959. My academic interests weren't narrowly focused on computers & technology; I was also interested in the humanities, specifically in Continental philosophy, literary theory, avant-garde poetry, American regionalism, and Irish Studies; even more specifically, I was interested in becoming a (bonafide) professor, which meant cultivating a (bonafide) set of specializations, ideally with the assistance of a mentor who could guide me into professoriat nd vouch for me as a junior scholar when it came time to apply to (bonafide) PhD programs. There were zero ongoing inter-disciplinary exchanges connecting my university's literary scholars and computer scientists, which meant there were also zero professors on campus who could credibly evaluate inter-disciplinary work. It also meant there were zero professors on campus who could direct my academic progress as someone operating at the intersection of bytes and books. </p> <p class=\"journey_text\"> Rather than go it alone I opted, quite understandably I think, to take advantage of the academic resources already at my disposal. </p> <p class=\"journey_text\"> Over the next few years, I gradually drifted further away from the Web and deeper into the groves of academe. My initial attempts to get into a top-tier PhD program were unsuccessful, but, after a brief interlude as a admin, many sleepless nights rethinking my application strategy, relentless networking, and somehow managing to be in two Master's programs simultaneously, the <a href=\"https://www.nd.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Notre Dame</a> invited me to begin my PhD under the auspices of their <a href=\"https://irishlanguage.nd.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Irish Language and Literature</a>. </p> <p class=\"journey_text\"> Victory! Or so I thought. When I tried to renew my lease at the end of my first year, <a href=\"https://www.irishresidential.com/\" target=\"_blank\">the landlords</a> raised the rent by more than <span class=\"text_emphasis\">$2,000 a month</span>! (Unbeknownst to me, they usually rented <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/312+S+St+Peter+St,+South+Bend,+IN+46617/@41.6733235,-86.2398454,3a,75y,77.81h,90t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sjngNxqZa0_KLJt2sqMxEMw!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DjngNxqZa0_KLJt2sqMxEMw%26cb_client%3Dsearch.gws-prod.gps%26w%3D86%26h%3D86%26yaw%3D77.81287%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i3328!8i1664!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x8816cd3c2326f86f:0x2bb2c386abd38478!2s312+S+St+Peter+St,+South+Bend,+IN+46617!3b1!8m2!3d41.6733619!4d-86.2395777!3m4!1s0x8816cd3c2326f86f:0x2bb2c386abd38478!8m2!3d41.6733619!4d-86.2395777\" target=\"_blank\">the property</a> by the room to undergraduates, not <span class=\"text_emphasis\">en bloc</span> to poor doctoral students. Now that they had a chance triple their monthly income, I had to go.) Moving out to South Bend had exhausted my savings, and the modest stipend Notre Dame gave me each month didn't come close to covering two months' rent plus a security deposit. After trying, and failing, to convince my landlords to change their minds, I quietly withdrew from the University of Notre Dame, called up my parents, and asked them to lend me the money to move back to Philadelphia. Almost as quickly as it had begun, my academic career was over. </p> <p class=\"journey_text\"> As any academic will tell you, <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/academes-extinction-event-failure-whiskey-and-professional-collapse-at-the-mla/\" target=\"_blank\">the professional culture of American higher ed is kind of a mess</a>. (If you don't believe me, do a quick <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=%22academia%22+and+%22failure%22\">Google search for \"academia\" and \"failure\"</a>.) The process which \"prepares\" people to become professors also encourages them to conflate their personal and professional selves. Frank discussion about the <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2021/02/09/new-reality-humanities-phds-transformation-not-crisis-moment-opinion\">abmyssal job market</a> is discouraged, as are most attempts to chart a professional course outside the university system. For many, the prospect of life outside of academia seems all-but-unthinkable, until it becomes all-but-inescapable. Thankfully, I had some sense of this going into my PhD program, and, although I didn't anticipate my academic career collapsing quite so soon, I'd already begun hedging my bets. </p> <p class=\"journey_text\"> With the help from some friends, I was able to wrangle admission to <a href=\"https://www1.villanova.edu/university/business/academics/graduate-programs/mba/flex-track.html\" target=\"_blank\">my old alma matar's \"flex track\" MBA program</a>; within a semester of starting business school, I was also able to talk my way into an <a href=\"https://www1.villanova.edu/university/business/academics/graduate-programs/mba/flex-track/fellowship-program.html\" target=\"_blank\">MBA Fellowship</a>, which was a Godsend because it allowed me to get my MBA for free. Less than a year after leaving Notre Dame, I'd done a professional 180. I had a new focus and a new plan: if I couldn't beat them, I was going to join them! I set my sights on a new career in the financial services industry. </p> <p class=\"journey_text\"> Unfortunately, I hadn't anticipated the possibility that I could neither beat them nor join them; more specifically, I drastically underestimated the financial sector's willingness to hire non-conventional candidates for entry-level positions. Although I had solid references, great grades, a somewhat unhealthy love of Excel spreadsheets (which, admittedly, persists to this day), and a killer origin story, not a single financial services firm wanted to take a chance on an \"older\" candidate with an MBA but not (real) prior business experience. Although I applied to hundreds of firms, I only ever got a handful of interviews, and no real offers. </p>    </div>   </div>  </div> </main> <script src=\"https://kit.fontawesome.com/d2b0003921.js\" crossorigin async defer></script> </body></html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"2691af93eb631f221dd08a6c85bb6f2c","cacheData":{}}
