              Like a lot of people who followed a “non-traditional” path into
              web development, it took me a while to realize my interests &
              (non-technical) skills were a perfect springboard to a Web-based
              career.
            </p>
            <p>
              The prospect of teaching myself to code was intimidating and I
              didn't understand my liberal arts background was a potential
              asset, not something I needed to apologize for.
            </p>
            <p>
              It took me a bit to push past these blind spots but eventually I did.
              And now I wake up everyday ready to
              build something cool and learn something new!

              There were plenty of blind alleys. There were plenty of strange
              digressions. There were protracted periods of time where I didn’t
              seem to move at all, or even seemed to be moving backwards.
              Throughout it all, though, the Web was always there, pursuing its
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O2FSuLkTSc" target="_blank">own peripatetic development</a>, somehow both serenely indifferent to my progress and yet always
              eager to welcome me back whenever (and whyever) I logged on to
              learn more.

              And why did I keep logging back on? I like to think the answer was
              that I understood the liberatory potential of the web from a
              pretty early age. (I know, I know: don’t worry. I realize this had
              more to do with dumb luck - being born at the right time, in the
              right place, to the right people - than youthful precociousness.)
              Quite improbably, for instance, my adolescence coincided with the
              handful of years when the Web’s residual counter-cultural/utopian
              weirdness existed in an uneasy equilibrium with the rising, and
              much more overtly commercial, ambitions of venture capitalists,
              entrepreneurs, and early adopters. Serendipitously, the Web was
              trying to figure out who it was right around the same time I (and
              a few hundred-thousand-other teenagers with dial-up access) were
              trying to figure out who were, too.

              With the help of Altavista, Geocities, and (then ubiquitous)
              <a href="https://hover.blog/what-ever-happened-to-webrings/" target="_blank">
                web rings</a>, we put our questions on the Information Superhighway and helped
              each other parse the contradictory answers. Together, we
              discovered
              <a href="https://www.avclub.com/with-zines-the-90s-punk-scene-had-a-living-history-1798241222">zines</a>,
              <a href="https://archive.org/details/happymutanthandb00frau" target="_blank">
                culture jamming</a>,
              <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19980207011355/http://oblivion.net/oblivion/" target="_blank">
                online (h)ac(k)tivism</a>, indie film, and
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn0IM86uC5U" target="_blank">music you couldn’t hear on the radio</a>
              . Inspired by the efforts of our analog predecessors in the punk &
              DIY movements, we taught ourselves the basics of web development
              and began
              <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23567744" target="_blank">creating our own communities
                <span class="text_emphasis">and</span> our own content</a>. Quite often, these formative online experiences had equally
              formative offline consequences - in my case, for example, my first
              website was an underground newspaper that got me
              <a href="/pdfs/eustace_student_handbook_free_press_rule.pdf" target="_blank">kicked out of Catholic prep school</a>
              - but conflict & personal drama were not, strictly speaking, the
              most formative aspects of our work. Underneath it all, I believe
              we always appreciated the fact the basic building blocks of the
              Web - the things that we were using to build other things - were
              freely available to anyone who wanted to use them.

              When I started college back in the early Aughts, web development,
              at least where I was, was very much the red-headed stepchild of
              the Computer Science department. Smartphones had yet to send
              developers on their long march through the viewports, which meant
              that HTML & CSS were viewed more as design tools than
              <a href="https://cloudfour.com/thinks/an-html-attribute-potentially-worth-4-4m-to-chipotle/" target="_blank">business-critical programming languages</a>
              in their own right, a bias reflected in the fact so many
              professionals working in (what we would now call) "front-end
              development" felt more comfortable in Dreamweaver than on the
              command line. Studying web development at the university-level
              obliged you to study a bunch of other stuff, like
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture" target="_blank">von Neumann architecture</a>, as well and, although it was all conceptually interesting
              enough, you went in with the understanding most of your courses
              would focus on things that were at best Web adjacent; there were
              little-to-no opportunities to develop your understanding of the
              Web as a rapidly evolving technology in its own right; and the few
              opportunities that did exist were, to borrow

              Compounding this relatively recent problem was another, older
              problem: the

" target="_blank">
                "two cultures" problem</a>
              identified by C. P. Snow way back in 1959. My academic interests
              weren't narrowly focused on computers & technology; I was also
              interested in the humanities, specifically in Continental
              philosophy, literary theory, avant-garde poetry, American
              regionalism, and Irish Studies; even more specifically, I was
              interested in becoming a (bonafide) professor, which meant
              cultivating a (bonafide) set of specializations, ideally with the
              assistance of a mentor who could teach me the professoriat's
              secret handshakes and vouch for me when it came time to apply to
              (bonafide) PhD programs. There were zero ongoing
              inter-disciplinary exchanges connecting my university's literary
              scholars to its computer scientists, which meant there were zero
              professors on campus who could credibly evaluate that sort of
              inter-disciplinary work. It also meant there were zero professors
              on campus who could direct my academic progress as someone
              operating at the intersection of bytes and books.

              Over the next few years, I gradually drifted further away from the
              Web and deeper into the groves of academe. My initial attempts to
              get into a top-tier PhD program were unsuccessful, but, after a
              brief interlude as an admin, many sleepless nights rethinking my
              application strategy, relentless networking, and somehow managing
              to be in two Master's programs simultaneously, the
              <a href="https://www.nd.edu/" target="_blank">University of Notre Dame</a>

              <a href="https://www.irishresidential.com/" target="_blank">the landlords</a>

              exhausted my savings, and the modest stipend Notre Dame gave me
              each month didn't come close to covering two months' rent plus a
              security deposit. After trying, and failing, to convince my
              landlords to change their minds, I quietly withdrew from the
              University of Notre Dame, called up my family, and asked them to
              lend me the money to move back to Philadelphia. Almost as quickly
              as it had begun, my academic career was over.

                Inspiration came from an unlikely place. One day in class we
                were discussing the anxiety-inducing process of choosing an
                undergraduate major and, by extension, a career. To situate this
                process within the historical evolution of the American
                university system, I sketched out the differences between
                pre-professionalization and
                <a href="https://www.uzh.ch/cmsssl/ife/dam/jcr:ffffffff-bb47-55f9-ffff-ffffe58ee284/LectureBerlindefdef.pdf" target="_blank">the German concept of "self-cultivation" or
                  <span class="text_emphasis">bildung</span></a>. I'd lectured on this topic before but, for whatever reason,
                on <span class="text_emphasis">this</span> particular day, I
                felt compelled to share my own experiences as an undergraduate,
                including my near-hit of a Computer Science major. My regret
                must have been palpable because, after class, a young Comp Sci
                major approached me and offered to give me a crash course in
                basic coding! I gratefully accepted the offer and, about a week
                later, I was sitting in an empty classroom in front of my own
                student, walking through the first piece of real code I'd
                "write" in over a decade.

              It convinced me to take (yet another) leap into the dark and start
              cold calling & e-mailing local tech companies. (The Web had been
              an integral part of my adolescence; perhaps it could be it an
              integral part of my adulthood as well?) My pitch was fairly
              straightforward: I was a part-time adjunct with ~15 hours of free
              time a week; I had no desire to remain an adjunct; I had a
              business degree; I was interested in web development; I was happy
              to intern anywhere in their organization they thought I might add
              value. To my surprise and delight, almost everyone I reached out
              to took the time to get back to me. I had some great conversations
              with some wonderful people, which pretty much all ended with the
              same feedback:
            </p>
            <p class="journey_text paragraph_emphasis">
              "You seem like a highly-motivated candidate with lots of
              potential, but you'll have a hard time convincing anyone to let
              you anywhere near a technical role if you don't know at least
              <span class="text_emphasis">some</span> code."
            </p>
            <p class="journey_text">
              That was enough for me: I began the laborious process of teaching
              myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript almost immediately!

                I say "laborious" because I couldn't afford a coding bootcamp
                and was obliged to create my own curricula utilizing whatever
                resources were free or cheaply available. Although there was no
                shortage of "teach yourself to code" content on the Web, finding
                sources that were up-to-date and focused on methodically
                learning web dev fundamentals proved challenging, especially
                since
                <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/discovering-unkunks/" target="_blank">I didn't already know</a>
                precisely what "web dev fundamentals" were. Quora & Stack

                My coding skills weren't where they needed to be for a full-time
                web dev offer, but I nevertheless managed to find
                <a href="https://larrymg.me/my_work/resume/.html" target="_blank">a hybrid tech/marketing/content creation role at a small
                  coaching firm</a>
                that, among other things, allowed me to apply my burgeoning dev
                skills to event landing pages created via
                <a href="https://unbounce.com/" target="_blank">Unbounce</a>.
                After a year-or-so, I felt my opportunities for on-the-job
                growth had plateaued, so I transitioned to
                <a href="htts://larrymg.me/my_work/resume.html" target="_blank">another hybrid role in the non-profit sector</a>
                I hoped would allow me to continue levelling-up. The
                <a href="https://www1.villanova.edu/villanova/business/newsevents/news/pressreleases/2017/1019.html" target="_blank">work was rewarding</a>
                and the
                <a href="https://cdiphila.org/about_us" target="_blank">organization's mission was laudable</a>
                but, as is so often in the case with non-profits, my colleagues
                & I often found ourselves under-resourced & over-worked. This
                left little time for developing and testing new tools, even less
                time for on-the-job training in web-based technologies, and
                virtually no time after work for self-directed study. Although I
                was able to identify & leverage several SaaS tools that helped
                us streamline existing processes, these were all
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG" target="_blank">WYSIWYG</a>
                web apps that placed a UI between myself and the underlying code
                I was (still) trying to understand and master.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although my situation was by no means dire, it felt like the
                possibility of breaking into web development was slipping away.
                I decided to take a gamble and reached out to my previous
                employer. Like a lot of small business owners, she was still
                struggling to build & maintain her brand on the web; and, like a
                lot of small business owners, she couldn't afford to hire an
                experienced dev to help her. I, on the other hand, knew enough
                about web development to do
                <span class="text_emphasis">some</span> things, but not enough
                to convince a tech firm to take me on full-time. In short, it
                seemed like our respective interests & limitations were
                well-aligned. I proposed she hire me to do web development for
                her business, with the understanding that, at least initially,
                I'd be spending part of every working day learning my craft and
                the remaining part of the day applying what I learned to her
                business.

              That single "yes" gave me permission to begin thinking of myself
              as an honest-to-God "front-end web developer." More importantly,
              it also gave me permission to place the Web at the center of my
              working life. Web development was no longer something I was
              learning "in the evenings", "on the weekends", or "in my spare
              time"; it was now an integral part of what I was expected to do,
              and to know, everyday.

              This was thrilling and, at least initially, also frustrating and a
              more than bit terrifying. I set down a list of professional
              objectives I wanted to achieve in the first six months and worked
              hard to achieve each one, a process which quickly introduced me to
              the high-highs & low-lows of web development. Seemingly simple
              fixes or subtle UI tweaks regularly cropped up to stretch my
              debugging skills and remind me just how much more there was for me
              to learn. (On the plus side, these pain points gave me an early &
              abiding respect for CSS's elegance, importance, and underlying
              logic.) On other days, though, when I was able to to rapidly
              identify & fix a problem, carefully think through a dev impasse
              using first principles, or finish implementing a new UI idea,
              working with the Web felt genuinely intoxicating.

                vision into a tangible set of digital assets. In the course of a
                few years, I took my employer from an identikit WordPress

                2020, I launched my first serious side-project,
                <a href="https://marathon.christmas" target="_blank">a community fansite</a>

                I've regularly listened to for decades. The positive feedback
                (and insane web traffic) I received from fellow listeners was
                humbling, to put it mildly, as was the real sense of
                accomplishment I hadn't experienced since I was admitted to
                Notre Dame.

              And that brings us up to today! I've never been more confident
              that I'm working in the right field, and I'm so incredibly

                My Web Dev Journey has been
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR4HjTH_fTM" target="_blank">a long & winding one</a>
                and, if I'm being honest, there are still days I wake up
                half-amazed at how far I've come. I know I'm not the only
                liberal arts major out there who's had to navigate one, two, or
                even three career shifts before the age of 40, so let me end
                with a few pieces of unsolicited advice, caution, and
                encouragement for anyone who may be about to embark on a Web Dev
                Journey of their own:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  No matter how hard it seems, no matter how much you still have
                  to learn, no matter how stupid you might feel, now matter how
                  discouraged you get, no matter how little time you might have
                  to spend learning code at any given moment:
                  <span class="first_line">KEEP GOING. You can do this. Trust me.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="first_line">When you're initially learning CSS, it can be challenging
                    to come up with ideas to implement as a budding
                    developer.</span>
                  Strange as may sound, the
                  <a href="https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/services/publications/fhwaop02084/index.htm" target="_blank">street signs you pass everyday</a>
                  can be a invaluable source of inspiration here. Recreating
                  them using HTML & CSS can help you apply much of what you're
                  learning without taking on the additional mental overhead of
                  design work. Once you've mastered the art of recreating street
                  signs, move over to Pinterest and start searching for
                  interesting
                  <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=%22magazine%20layout%22&rs=typed&term_meta[]=%22magazine%7Ctyped&term_meta[]=layout%22%7Ctyped" target="_blank">magazine layouts</a>
                  to recreate using more advanced CSS techniques & tools.

                <li>
                  <span class="first_line">The transition into web development takes time and,
                    although it (probably) can be expedited with the proper
                    guidance and planning, it can't be rushed.</span>
                  Why? Because there's an important distinction to be made
                  between "knowing how to code" and "knowing how to think like a
                  developer." If you approach development as a bag-of-tricks
                  (e.g. snippets, fashionable frameworks, third-party tools,
                  etc.), you'll learn how to
                  <span class="text_emphasis" style="display: inline-block">work with code</span>
                  but you'll struggle to understand
                  <span class="text_emphasis">why code works</span>, either in
                  general or in specific use cases. If you're serious about
                  becoming a web dev, be patient with yourself and push yourself
                  to develop the latter while you're familiarizing yourself with
                  the former.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="first_line">The discipline, resilience, and adaptability you'll
                    cultivate learning how to think like a developer are what
                    make you valuable; the fluency, speed, and efficiency you'll
                    cultivate learning how to code are what make you
                    profitable.</span>
                  The latter is what will land you your first job; the former is
                  what will sustain you over the course of your career. Don't
                  neglect the need profitable, but always prioritize sources of
                  value over sources of profit.
                </li>

                <li>
                  If the prospect of learning something new, everyday, for the
                  rest of your career appeals to you, then you may (already) be
                  a web dev. That said, there's an important professional
                  corrollary to continuous learning that's often overlooked: the
                  impossibility of every knowing "everything" there is to know
                  about the Web. If approached correctly, working as a web
                  developer gets easier over time, but it will never really be
                  easy. You can optimize for change, but this isn't a line of
                  work (like teaching an intro-level undergrad course) where,
                  after an initial period of intense study & practice, you can
                  coast on what you already know indefinitely.

                    <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/beginners-mind" target="_blank">perpetually return to a beginner's state of mind</a>, this isn't the career path for you.</span>
