              There were plenty of blind alleys. There were plenty of strange
              digressions. There were protracted periods of time where I didn’t
              seem to move at all, or even seemed to be moving backwards.
              Throughout it all, though, the Web was always there, pursuing its

              eager to welcome me back whenever (and whyever) I logged on to
              learn more.
            </p>
            <p class="journey_text">
              And why did I keep logging back on? I think the answer was the
              liberatory potential of the web spoke to me from a pretty early
              age. (I know, I know: don’t worry. I realize this had more to do
              with dumb luck - being born at the right time, in the right place,
              to the right people - than youthful precociousness.) Quite
              improbably, for instance, my adolescence coincided with the
              handful of years when the Web’s residual counter-cultural/utopian
              weirdness existed in an uneasy equilibrium with the rising, and
              much more overtly commercial, ambitions of venture capitalists,
              entrepreneurs, and early adopters. Serendipitously, the Web was
              trying to figure out who it was right around the same I (and a few
              hundred thousand other teenagers with dial-up access) were trying
              to figure out who were, too.

              . Inspired by the efforts of our analog predecessors in the punk &
              DIY movements, we taught ourselves the basics of web development
              and began
              <a
                href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23567744"

                <span class="text_emphasis">and</span> our own content</a
              >. Quite often, these formative online experiences had equally
              formative offline consequences - in my case, for example, my first
              website was an underground newspaper that got me
              <a

                >kicked out of Catholic prep school</a
              >
              - but conflict & personal drama were not, strictly speaking, the
              most formative aspects of our work. Underneath it all, I believe
              we always appreciated the fact the basic building blocks of the
              Web - the things that we were using to build other things - were
              freely available to anyone who wanted to use them.

            <p class="journey_text paragraph_emphasis grid_text_center">
              I guess what I'm trying to say here is: I've always been a web
              developer. It just took me a little longer than I would've liked
              to realize it.
            </p>

            <p class="journey_text">
              Why did it take me so long? Again, it seems important to stress
              the role of circumstances largely beyond my control.

            <p class="journey_text">
              When I started college back in the early Aughts, web development,
              at least where I was, was very much the red-headed stepchild of
              the Computer Science department. Smartphones had yet to send
              developers on their long march through the viewports, which meant
              that HTML & CSS were viewed more as design tools than
              <a

                >business-critical programming languages</a
              >
              in their own right, a bias reflected in the fact so many
              professionals working in (what we would now call) "front-end
              development" felt more comfortable in Dreamweaver than they did on
              the command line. Studying web development at the university-level
              obliged you to study a bunch of other stuff, like
              <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture"

              >, as well and, although it was all conceptually interesting
              enough, you went in with the understanding most of your courses
              would focus on things that were, at best, Web adjacent; there were
              little-to-no opportunities to develop your understanding of the
              Web as a rapidly evolving technology in its own right; and the few
              opportunities that did exist were, to borrow

                "two cultures" problem</a
              >
              identified by C. P. Snow way back in 1959. My academic interests
              weren't narrowly focused on computers & technology; I was also
              interested in the humanities, specifically in Continental
              philosophy, literary theory, avant-garde poetry, American
              regionalism, and Irish Studies; even more specifically, I was
              interested in becoming a (bonafide) professor, which meant
              cultivating a (bonafide) set of specializations, ideally with the
              assistance of a mentor who could guide me into the groves of
              academe and vouch for me as a junior scholar when it came time to
              apply to (bonafide) PhD programs. There were zero ongoing
              inter-disciplinary exchanges connecting my university's literary
              scholars and computer scientists, which meant there were also zero
              professors on campus who could credibly evaluate
              inter-disciplinary work. It also meant there were zero professors
              on campus who could direct my academic progress as someone
              operating at the intersection of bytes and books.
