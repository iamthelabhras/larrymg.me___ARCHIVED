              There were plenty of blind alleys. There were plenty of strange
              digressions. There were protracted periods of time where I didn’t
              seem to move at all, or even seemed to be moving backwards.

              And why did I keep logging back on? I think the answer was the
              liberatory potential of the web spoke to me from a pretty early
              age. (I know, I know: don’t worry. I realize this had more to do
              with dumb luck - being born at the right time, in the right place,
              to the right people - than youthful precociousness.) Quite
              improbably, for instance, my adolescence coincided with the
              handful of years when the Web’s residual counter-cultural/utopian
              weirdness existed in an uneasy equilibrium with the rising, and
              much more overtly commercial, ambitions of venture capitalists,
              entrepreneurs, and early adopters. Serendipitously, the Web was
              trying to figure out who it was right around the same time I (and
              a few hundred-thousand-other teenagers with dial-up access) were
              trying to figure out who were, too.

              . Inspired by the efforts of our analog predecessors in the punk &
              DIY movements, we taught ourselves the basics of web development
              and began

                <span class="text_emphasis">and</span> our own content</a

              formative offline consequences - in my case, for example, my first
              website was an underground newspaper that got me

              - but conflict & personal drama were not, strictly speaking, the
              most formative aspects of our work. Underneath it all, I believe
              we always appreciated the fact the basic building blocks of the
              Web - the things that we were using to build other things - were
              freely available to anyone who wanted to use them.

              Why did it take me so long? Again, it seems important to stress
              the role of circumstances largely beyond my control.

              When I started college back in the early Aughts, web development,
              at least where I was, was very much the red-headed stepchild of
              the Computer Science department. Smartphones had yet to send
              developers on their long march through the viewports, which meant
              that HTML & CSS were viewed more as design tools than
              <a

              in their own right, a bias reflected in the fact so many
              professionals working in (what we would now call) "front-end
              development" felt more comfortable in Dreamweaver than they did on
              the command line. Studying web development at the university-level
              obliged you to study a bunch of other stuff, like

              enough, you went in with the understanding most of your courses
              would focus on things that were, at best, Web adjacent; there were
              little-to-no opportunities to develop your understanding of the
              Web as a rapidly evolving technology in its own right; and the few
              opportunities that did exist were, to borrow

              identified by C. P. Snow way back in 1959. My academic interests
              weren't narrowly focused on computers & technology; I was also
              interested in the humanities, specifically in Continental
              philosophy, literary theory, avant-garde poetry, American
              regionalism, and Irish Studies; even more specifically, I was
              interested in becoming a (bonafide) professor, which meant
              cultivating a (bonafide) set of specializations, ideally with the
              assistance of a mentor who could guide me into professoriat nd
              vouch for me as a junior scholar when it came time to apply to
              (bonafide) PhD programs. There were zero ongoing
              inter-disciplinary exchanges connecting my university's literary
              scholars and computer scientists, which meant there were also zero
              professors on campus who could credibly evaluate
              inter-disciplinary work. It also meant there were zero professors
              on campus who could direct my academic progress as someone
              operating at the intersection of bytes and books.

              Rather than go it alone I opted, quite understandably I think, to

              Over the next few years, I gradually drifted further away from the
              Web and deeper into the groves of academe. My initial attempts to
              get into a top-tier PhD program were unsuccessful, but, after a
              brief interlude as an admin, many sleepless nights rethinking my
              application strategy, relentless networking, and somehow managing
              to be in two Master's programs simultaneously, the

              close to covering two months' rent plus a security deposit. After
              trying, and failing, to convince my landlords to change their
              minds, I quietly withdrew from the University of Notre Dame,
              called up my parents, and asked them to lend me the money to move
              back to Philadelphia. Almost as quickly as it had begun, my
              academic career was over.

              is discouraged, as are most attempts to chart a professional
              course outside the university system. For many, the prospect of
              life outside of academia seems all-but-unthinkable, until it
              becomes all-but-inescapable. Thankfully, I had some sense of this
              going into my PhD program, and, although I didn't anticipate my
              academic career collapsing quite so soon, I'd already begun
              hedging my bets.

                Unfortunately, I hadn't anticipated the possibility that I could
                neither beat them <span class="text_emphasis">nor</span> join
                them; more specifically, I drastically underestimated the
                financial sector's willingness to hire non-conventional
                candidates for entry-level positions. Although I had solid
                references, great grades, a somewhat unhealthy love of Excel
                spreadsheets (which persists to this day!), and a killer origin
                story, not a single financial services firm wanted to take a
                chance on an "older" candidate with an MBA but no (real) prior
                business experience. Although I applied to hundreds of firms, I
                only ever got a handful of interviews, and no real offers.
