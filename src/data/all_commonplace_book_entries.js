    body: 'My father often talked of things being revealed - that was true invention, he said.  Revealing something\'s use, and magnifying it; discovering its imperfections, improving it, and putting it to work for you.  God had left the world incomplete, he said, and it was man\'s job to understand how it worked, tinker with it, and to finish it.  I think that was why he hated missionaries so much - because they taught people to put up with their earthly burdens.  For father, there were no burdens that couldn\'t be fitted with a set of wheels, or rudders, or a system of pulleys.',

    body: 'I understand that this was my female relatives\' choice. Yet I also know how infrequently you truly make the choice to sacrifice something you love; it\'s more like a slow erosion. You give up one small thing, which makes it easier then to give up another, then another. After all, the men didn\'t ask them to make these sacrifices â€” asking that would require their acknowledgment there was something of value to give up.',
