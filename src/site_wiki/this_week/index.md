# This Week's Updates

## Overview

FÃ¡ilte!  This section of larrymg.me is where all weekly site updates are archived on a rolling basis.

Currently, these updates include: 

    * What I'm Learning This Week

    * What I'm Watching This Week
    * This Week's Hot Track
    * This Week's Hot Laugh
    
This section of my site was created using Vimwiki & MDwiki.  

[Vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) is (surprise!) a personal wiki for Vim/Neovim that allows me to easily create & navigate between inter-linked Markdown files.  It's an incredily *simple* but also an incredibly *powerful* tool for knowledge capture and retrieval.  If you're an avid Vim or Neovim user, I highly recommend checking it out.

[MDwiki](https://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/#!download.md) is a templating & static-site generation engine built on top of VimWiki.  It's also incredible easy to use and makes these weekly site updates a breeze.  Just drop a single html file (`mdwiki-latest.html`) into a directory with a bunch of Markdown files and you're good to go.  Also highly recommended!
